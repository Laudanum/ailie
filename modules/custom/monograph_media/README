1	register a hook_theme at a particular path in .module
2	pass in variables at hook_file_formatter_FORMATTER_view in formatters.inc
3	pick up variables again in the preprocessor in includes/themes/theme.inc eg monograph_media_preprocess_monograph_media_video
4	finally use the variables there writing the html . presumably there could be a monograph-media-video.tpl.php file too . which would take precedence ?
